This repository is an elixir website for `https://store.elementary.io`. It
connects to Printful for products, and Stripe for payment processing.

## Developing on elementary OS (or Ubuntu)

This guide assumes elementary OS 6 or Ubuntu 20.04; the steps should be similar for any Ubuntu-based OS, but may differ bassed on the exact distribution or version.

1. **Install Docker**

   You can install Docker however you'd like, but we recommend following [this DigitalOcean guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04), including adding your user to the `docker` group.

2. **Install `docker-compose`**

   Similarly, you can install docker-compose however you see fit, but the fastest way is probably via Python's `pip`:

   1. `sudo apt install python3-pip`
   2. `pip3 install docker-compose`

3. **Configure secrets** for development

   Add your Printful API key to `config/dev.secret.exs` like so:

   ```ex
   import Config

   config :store, Printful.Api,
     api_key: "aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc:dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee"
   ```
   
   To test Stripe integration as well, add your Stripe test keys to `config/dev.secret.exs`:

   ```ex
   config :stripity_stripe,
     api_key: "sk_test_aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwX",
     public_key: "pk_test_zYxWvUtSrQpOnMlKjIhGfEdC"
   ```

That's it, you're all set to start contributing.

## Running

This repository contains a `docker-compose.yml` file for easier development.
Make sure you have `docker-compose` installed, then run these commands:

1) `docker-compose build` to build the containers. If you make changes to any
dependencies, or are getting issues where code does not seem to update, re-run
this step.

2) `docker-compose up` to start the server and dependencies. This is your main
command and after you run steps 1 and 2, you should only need to run this
command to get back up and running.

If you change any configuration/secrets, you need to restart `docker-compose up` for it to take effect.
